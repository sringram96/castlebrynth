/**
 * Every player-facing word. rules/voice.md binds all of it: second person,

 * of text at a time — a beat is ~45 words or fewer. The labyrinth never
 * explains itself twice.
 *
 * Engine code contains no prose. This is the only file that says anything
 * out loud.
 *
 * One exception, and it is a law rather than a leak: `VERBS` are controls,
 * and art. 66 exempts controls from the voice register and binds them to
 * itself instead — a plain imperative verb, two words or fewer. They are
 * linted against that rule and not against this file's.
 *
 * **Placeholder, this tranche.** The register pass is a later task, and the
 * debt is written in DESIGN.md. What is *not* placeholder any more is that
 * every room says its own name in its first candle: art. 34 hangs knowledge
 * on room identity, and a room the player cannot name is a room they cannot
 * learn.
